## Project Name: G/Wolf

#### Check In 1

#### Project Pitch
G/Wolf is a 4 person golf game tracking app, that keeps scores, tallies and teams related to the golf game of wolf. This app prompts players too tee off, and manages the game for them, so that the players can focus on competing and not keeping track of complex tallying.

### Deliverables

#### Stack:
React, Router, Redux

#### APIs:
Golfbert API to create sample course data.

#### Wireframes

#### Order Of Attack
Settle on file architecture
Settle on API access
Refine wireframe 
Create a general aesthetic. 

#### MVP
4 person player creation. GPS location prompts. Randomize order on first tee. Allow wolf to select a teamate or to play a hole alone. Allow for multiple scoring types - Better ball, stroke play, match play. Automatic team scoring. End of round points/score tally.


#### Nice To Haves
Handicap tracking / adjustment. Score equalizing. Golf Card scanning with camera. Send SMS prompts to other players. Backend database setup to allow for history / stats over time.


#### Biggest Challenges
Making the interface intuitive for golfers who have never played wolf.

#### Instructor Notes

#### Deliverables for next checkin:
- Have react boilerplate (react, redux, and router setup) 
- Have store populated with course data 
- TDD the API utility. 
- Grab current location and set it in the store.
